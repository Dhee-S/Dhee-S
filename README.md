# 👋 Hey there, I’m Dheepak!  

🎯 **AI Explorer | Data Science Learner | Creative Engineer**

I’m a passionate developer who believes that technology and imagination together can solve almost anything.  
I love designing systems that *think* — transforming raw data into intelligent, intuitive, and impactful experiences.  

Currently, I’m working on building smarter web applications powered by AI and machine learning —  
like my **Career Prediction App**, which helps users discover the right career path based on their skills and interests.
